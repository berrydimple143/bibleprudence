            We are independent body who aims to provide free Bible resources and games such as
            Bible Quiz, Bible Scavenger, the Bible itself with different versions, and others. Some of
            these resources are free to download (in pdf format) like the Bible Quiz and we are still developing
            other fun games which are already existing in our local congregation located at
            Davao City, Philippines.
        </p>
        <p class="px-3 text-justify pb-3">We make almost every application on this website to be more fun,
            interactive and very insightful. As you can notice the Bible quiz game is fetched randomly and has a comment
            button
            at the right of the question so that users can interact with the particular question or its
            answer and its downloadable pdf file (up to {{ $qlimit->limit }} items) contains the Bible verse(s) on which a question's answer
            can be found. So also with the Bible Scavenger game.
        </p>

            We've designed every application on this website with this goal "To be more focused in God's
            word rather than being addicted in worldly games".
